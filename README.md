# Trading Bot

The goals and actual implementations of this project are currently as follows:  

1. Be able create a cryptocurrency trading bot that can run in real-time and deliver accurate, profit hungry results.
2. Using machine learning to build a model to predict cryptocurrency price trends.
3. Build an intuitive and functional User-interface


## Code Developed By Team 28
Team 28 is soley responsible for developing the user interface used in this projects as well as the machine learning models and the trading strategies.

Reinforcement learning training [bot](https://github.com/JacobMayer/Blankly/blob/NicholasWard-RienforcementLearning/bot_training.py) python file created functionality for multiple different reinforcement learning algorithms as well as the ability for multiple cpu support, and model saving capabilities.

## Code Integrated From Other Sources
The Blankly repository was used to implement the API calls, visualize data and calculate return on investment as well as trade across multiple exchanges

In the reinforcement learning branch, gym trading environments were created from [gym_anytrading](https://github.com/AminHP/gym-anytrading)

The reinforcement models were developed by [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/baselines)

## Justin Carlson's Contributions
Justin was responsible for designing UI and modeling the data into an easy-to-read graphic format for the user. 


## Zimuzo Agu's Contributions
Zimuzo was responsible for designing the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model and integrating it into the program.


## Jake Mayer's Contributions
Jake was responsible for researching the packages and libraries that were used in the project, as well as UI creation such as the dashboard page (index.html), implemented strategies including RSI, MACD, Golden Cross and Death Cross. He was also responsible for Team 28's Logo, as well as organizing, commenting, and maintaining links in the projects code. Additionally, he was responsible for the initial creation and maintaining of the blog website (PWEB), as well as creating and connecting API keys to the various stock and crypto exchanges for the project to function properly. He also experimented with numerous UI ideas such as Kivy, until the team settled on an online solution, flask, then bug tested the website to identify errors and inconsistencies in titles and redirects.


## Nicholas Ward Contributions
Nicholas was responsible for creating the Reinforcement Learning, XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron and Prophet machine learning methods into the trading bot. As well as UI for models page.
