# Trading Bot

The goals and actual implementations of this project are currently as follows:  

1. Be able create a cryptocurrency trading bot that can run in real-time and deliver accurate, profit hungry results.
2. Using machine learning to build a model to predict cryptocurrency price trends.
3. Build an intuitive and functional User-interface


## Code Developed By Team 28
Team 28 is soley responsible for developing the user interface used in this projects as well as the machine learning models and the trading strategies.

## Code Integrated From Other Sources
The creation of the graphs was integrated from other sources.

In the rienforcement learning branch, gym trading environment was created from [gym_anytrading](https://github.com/AminHP/gym-anytrading)

## Justin Carlson's Contributions
Justin was responsible for designing UI and modeling the data into an easy-to-read graphic format for the user. 


## Zimuzo Agu's Contributions
Zimuzo was responsible for designing the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model and integrating it into the program.


## Jake Mayer's Contributions
Jake was responsible for implementing the trading strategies such as RSI and MACD into the code.


## Nicholas Ward Contributions
Nicholas was responsible for creating the Reinforcement Learning machine learning method into the trading bot.
