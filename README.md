# Trading Bot

The goals and actual implementations of this project are currently as follows:  

1. Be able create a cryptocurrency trading bot that can run in real-time and deliver accurate, profit hungry results.
2. Using machine learning to build a model to predict cryptocurrency price trends.
3. Build an intuitive and functional User-interface


## Code Developed By Team 28
Team 28 is soley responsible for developing the user interface used in this projects as well as the machine learning models and the trading strategies.

Reinforcement learning training [bot](https://github.com/JacobMayer/Blankly/blob/NicholasWard-RienforcementLearning/bot_training.py) python file created functionality for multiple different reinforcement learning algorithms as well as the ability for multiple cpu support, and model saving capabilities.

## Code Integrated From Other Sources
The Blankly repository was used to implement the API calls, visualize data and calculate return on investment as well as trade across multiple exchanges

In the reinforcement learning branch, gym trading environments were created from [gym_anytrading](https://github.com/AminHP/gym-anytrading)

The reinforcement models were developed by [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/baselines)
