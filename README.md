# Trading Bot


## Description of Project
The Machine Learning Trading Bot (MLTB) is a bot that uses machine learning methods to trade stocks and cryptocurrency algorithmically. The main goal of the MLTB is to assist investors in becoming as profitable as possible. By giving users powerful machine learning trading strategies wrapped in an intuitive user interface, they will be able to make logical trades at a much higher frequency than they would be able to make individually. Our hope is that the bot will allow investors to minimize the risk and time spent on high frequency trading of financial assets.
